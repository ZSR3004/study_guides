\section{Dimensions}
First, we talk about bases.

\begin{prop}
    Suppose a vector space $V$ has a finite basis. Then, any two bases have the same number of elements in them.
\end{prop}

\begin{corollary}
    The basis of $\F^n$ has $n$ vectors in it.
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{dimension} of a vector space $V$, denoted by $\dimV{V}$, is the number of vectors in a basis for $V$ if $V$ has a finite basis.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The dimensions of $\{ \zV \}$ is $0$.
        \item If $V$is not finite-dimensional, then $V$ is infinitely-dimensional.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Using this definition, we can construct bases.
\begin{prop}
    Any linearly independent list of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ has at \textit{most} $\dimV{V}$ elements.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
    Any spanning list of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ has at \textit{least} $\dimV{V}$ elements.
\end{prop}

Following this,
\begin{thm}
    If $v_1, ..., v_r$ are linearly independent vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ with $\dimV{V} = n$, then there exists vectors
    $v_{r + 1}, ..., v_n$ so that $v_1, ..., v_n$ are a basis for $V$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $V$ be a subspace of a vector space $W$. Suppose $\dimV{W} \leq \infty$. Then,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $V$ is finite dimensional.
        \item $\dimV{V} \leq \dimV{W}$.
        \item If $\dimV{V} = \dimV{W}$, then $V = W$
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm}
