Let n in the natural numbers be arbitrary and D = {1, 5, 10, 25}. We will first show optimal substructures hold, then show greedy choice property holds.

Suppose there exists an optimal solution for n,
\begin{align*}
    \ga_1 (1) + \ga_5 (5) + \ga_{10} (10) + \ga_{25} (25) &= n
\end{align*}

Then, there exista  \ga_i for i = {1, 5, 10, 25} such that \ga_i >= c_i+1. However, this proves a contradiction, since the optimal solution would 
just include one more of the c_i+1

Suppose
